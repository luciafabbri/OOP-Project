-Renamed interface "TestInterfaceLevel" to "Level";
-Implementation of "Graphics" ("GraphicsImpl") now takes a "Level" argument, not Room (previously did this only to test);
-Removed function "New Resolution" from Room1 class;
-Complete re-work of how "Room" handles tiles and their coords;
-Added packages items, levels, tiles and genTest to distinguish classes inside project;
-Implemented interface "GameSettings" containing width, height and tilesize of objects;
-Created class "Floor1" containing texture and point of origin and end of drawing;
-Created class "walls1", same as "floor1", containing all of 4 walls;
-Renamed class and interface "Graphics" to "Rendering" because of name issues;
-Revamped "RenderingImpl" class;
-Revamped "Tile" class to have different types of implementation, each with their own characteristics;
-Same with "Items" class;

28/03/2020
-Implemented object Key;
-Added comments in classes RenderingImpl;
-Implemented inside "TestState" some tests for sprite movement for later real implementation (very basic movement in four cardinal directions);

31/03/2020 - 01/04/2020
-Change the static variables inside "GameSettings", so to have more flexibility when implementing sprites;

04/04/2020
-Renamed class "Level1" to "LevelImpl" and "Room1" to "RoomImpl" to accomodate new implementation regarding the random generating levels;
-Added a List of obstacles for future implementation inside RoomImpl;
-Added a List of Doors to implement dinamically based on number of rooms connected to the current one;

10/04/2020
-Implemented class Menu to act as a game menu once you start up the game, now mainly contains two buttons, one to start the game and one to close the application;
-Implemented levelID inside TestPlay to dinamically load level based on ID and algorithm given;
-Eliminated a copy of both GameSettings and Pair since they already exits, and updated dependecies;
-Added function to List of obstacles to be treated same with items;

11/04/2020 - 1
-Fixed some minor issues regarding the drawing of items (Keys more specifically);
-Implemented system to store all rooms that are created using the function generateLevel inside LeveelDesignGeneratorImpl;
-Implemented temporary system to switch between generated rooms to see if changes are applied;

11/04/2020 - 2
-Reimplemented the way the user can change rooms, because algorithm that generates rooms has changed;

14/04/2020
-Integrated and Implemented function inside RenderingImpl to draw obstacles temporarly for testing, more permanent solution will be implemented
once testing for entities has been done extensively;

15/04/2020
-Implemented maximum FPS recheable so performance should be the same regardless of system hardware;
-Implemented Player inside TestPlay, Logic and Rendering to perform test regarding the interaction of the mainChar with the world;
-Implemented inside Player a way to stop main character when walking in obstacles;
-Doors are now usable to traverse rooms;

19/04/2020
-Changed implementation of Items and Modifiers to use pickupables instead of entities;
